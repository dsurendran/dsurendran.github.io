<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />*For good ideas and true innovation, you need human interaction, conflict, argument, debate.* 'Margaret Heffernan'<br /><br />Workshop is all about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideation_(creative_process)">Ideation</a>, here is the brief sumarization of what went on 2 days workshop.<br /><br />How ever great the idea is unless it provides any value to user, its of no use.<br />To build an idea we need a problem worth solving, to find a problem we need to understand the users, so our day started with identifying the users (real world users) and build a <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-define-a-user-persona/">persona</a> of an users.<br /><br />This includes detailed profile of an user with his day to day activies. This gives more understanding of the enduser. The more you get close with your persona, better you understand your problem.<br /><br />Once we identified the users we started with <a href="https://www.appcues.com/blog/user-journey-map">users journey mapping</a>, how the users interface with our products. Outcome of this exercise is to identify the pain points of the customers<br /><br />Ideation:<br />Out of 'n' pain points choose one pain point worth to solve, design a solution which solves the chosen pain points, the solution should focus on three main values Customer (how useful it is to customers), Solution (feasible one), Business value(viable).<br /><br />User experience(UX):<br />Here comes the important aspect of any product, where user interact with the system. The goal is to keep it simple.<br />How can we quickly get feedback from users, it could be a working prototype or a simple elements sketched on a paper. For Example here is the twitters initial design<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2JdmdJw7jH8/W2dHDILpBKI/AAAAAAAAI2o/cwAueT8JZLQ7dwVmZ_wUwFrX_jSBVyqtwCLcBGAs/s1600/182613360_6d76db726a_z.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="640" data-original-width="480" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2JdmdJw7jH8/W2dHDILpBKI/AAAAAAAAI2o/cwAueT8JZLQ7dwVmZ_wUwFrX_jSBVyqtwCLcBGAs/s320/182613360_6d76db726a_z.jpg" width="240" /></a></div><br />source:&nbsp;https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdorsey/182613360<br /><br />Goal of the UX is,<br /><br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Protype-----&gt;Feedback---&gt;|<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;^ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp;|----&lt;------&lt;-------&lt;--------|<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span> <br /><br />Then comes the fun part of building an MVP.<br />Our goal was to build an MVP around our products value proposition.<br /><br />What is an MVP?<br />it should always be an working model, or it could be just a facebook page?<br /><br />short description from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">wiki</a>:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Results from a minimum viable product test aim to indicate if the product should be built to begin with. Testing evaluates if the initial problem or goal is solved in a manner that makes it reasonable to move forward.<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span><br />For our chosen product, what we ended up to our surprise is to build a simple web page to evaluate if the customers are intersted in our product. Success criteria for our MVP was to validate the number of users visiting and number of users completing the survey, which indicates how much are they ready to buy our product<br /><br />What are the take aways:<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Keep users @ the core in all your stages,<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>keep it as much simple as possible**<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Don't be fixed, let the ideas evolve at each stage, *BUT do not forget/deviate from the core problem you are addressing<br /><br /><div><br /></div></div>
